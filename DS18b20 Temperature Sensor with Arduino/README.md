In one of our previous tutorials, we have shown you how you can interface LM35 Temperature Sensor with Arduino because it's cheap, easy to use, and requires minuscule power for stable operation. But one of the major disadvantages of the LM35 sensor is that it is analog in nature, so it's sensitive to external noise. There are a variety of sensors that may be used to solve this problem but in today's article, we thought to cover the DS18b20 temperature sensor. Not only is this sensor inexpensive and simple to use, but it also has a one-of-a-kind 1-wire communication protocol that is simple to build and supports a wide range of devices that can connect with the CPU.
