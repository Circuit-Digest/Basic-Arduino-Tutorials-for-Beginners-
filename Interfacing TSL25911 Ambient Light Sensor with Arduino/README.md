Detecting the amount of light in the ambience is necessary for many areas of our everyday life. We use these kinds of light sensors in automatic lighting systems for smartphones or other smart devices. The perfect example of such a scenario is the auto-brightness control of our smartphones or laptops. The amount of light is measured by such devices and the screen brightness is adjusted proportionally to the ambient light. This avoids having the screen be too bright when the user's pupils are adapted for vision in a dark room, or too dim when the device is used outdoors in the daytime. Dimming the screen on a mobile device also prolongs the lifetime of the battery. So, in this tutorial letâ€™s look at such a sensor module built around the TSL25911 sensor.
