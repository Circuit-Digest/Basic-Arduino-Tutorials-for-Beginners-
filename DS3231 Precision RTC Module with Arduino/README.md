In today's world, time is everything, and when it comes to specific electronics, timing is critical; just like us, humans, they also need a way to keep track of time. So how do electronics do it? The answer is DS3231, a Real-Time Clock, often known as an RTC, is a timekeeping device built into an Integrated Circuit, or IC. It is used in many time-critical applications and devices, such as servers, GPS, and data loggers. Let's see what makes it TICK.
