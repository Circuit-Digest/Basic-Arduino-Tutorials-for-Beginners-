As you may know many of our everyday appliances or devices such as smartphones, home automation systems, smart speakers, headphones and many others have their own built-in microphones to capture the audio data. And if we look at them there are different types of microphones available, such as condenser, ribbon, dynamic and MEMS. The most modern devices like smartphones use MEMS microphones for better sensitivity. But the problem with them is that they are digital and will need digital processing to get the audio out of them. The analog-type microphones have been there for decades and they can be found from cheap toys to high-end studio setups. Among the analog type microphones, the most popular one would be the condenser microphone, they are cheap and easy to interface. But since their output signal is very weak we will need to do some amplification to the signal before using it. That's where microphone amplifiers come into play. So in this article, we will look into such a microphone amplifier module mashed on the MAX4466 IC, which offers an adjustable gain, and how to interface it with an Arduino.
