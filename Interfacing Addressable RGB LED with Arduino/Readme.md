When you require a dynamic lighting solution, LED strips are a great choice. They may be mounted almost anywhere, available in a variety of colours, and require very little maintenance. Finding another lighting system that offers as much value and style would be challenging. And even this standard is raised to a completely new level by addressable LED strips. They provide you with more control options and fun effects to add even more glitz to your lighting setup. These addressable LEDs can be easily controlled by an Arduino. So, in this tutorial, we are going to look at how to interface such LEDs with an Arduino. We will be interfacing the WS2812B LEDs which are also known as NeoPixel.
