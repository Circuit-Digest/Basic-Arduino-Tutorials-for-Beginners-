An infrared proximity sensor or IR Sensor is an electronic device that emits infrared lights to sense some aspect of the surroundings and can be employed to detect the motion of an object. As this is a passive sensor, it can only measure infrared radiation. This sensor is very common in the electronic industry and if you’ve ever tried to design an obstacle avoidance robot or any other proximity detection-based system, chances are you already know about this module, and if you don’t, then follow this article as here we will discuss everything about it.

Note: As this projects are very simple we are only providing the code, schemaitic, and a few essential images if you want to get the images or code explanations do check out the Circuit Digest website.
