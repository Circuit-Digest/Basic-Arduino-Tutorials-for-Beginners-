DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor features a temperature & humidity sensor
complex with a calibrated digital signal output. The exclusive digital-signal-acquisition technique and temperature & humidity sensing technology ensure high reliability and excellent long-term stability. This sensor includes an NTC for temperature measurement and a resistive-type humidity measurement component for humidity measurement. These are connected to a high-performance 8-bit microcontroller, offering excellent quality, fast response, anti-interference ability and cost-effectiveness.
