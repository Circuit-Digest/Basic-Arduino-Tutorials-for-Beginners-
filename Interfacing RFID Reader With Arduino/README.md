Have you ever wondered how the antitheft system in a supermarket works? Or how do automatic toll payment systems like fast tag work? All the answer to your doubts is RFID or Radio Frequency Identification. As the name indicates, RFID uses electromagnetic waves in the radio frequency spectrum for communication and data transfer. RFID tags are used in many industries. You can find them in product tags from stores to security access cards. RFID tags can expedite the checkout and can be used for antitheft measures. They can be also used for identifying livestock, products etc. In this tutorial, we will learn how we can use the RFID technology with the Arduino. We will learn how to interface the RC522 RFID reader with the Arduino.
