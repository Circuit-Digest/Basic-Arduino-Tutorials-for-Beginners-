A Hall effect sensor or Hall sensor is a magnetic non-contact sensor that generates an electrical signal proportional to the magnetic field applied to it. Hall effect sensors are widely used in industrial applications like current-sensing, position detection and contactless switching. They are basically like a small reed switch, when a magnetic field is around the output voltage will vary according to the magnetic flux. Hall effect sensors are used in BLDC applications because they are robust, accurate, and low failure rate.
<br>
This tutorial will see how we can interface such a Hall effect sensor with Arduino. The module we are going to use can be used either in analogue mode or in digital output mode. We will monitor the moduleâ€™s output and will change the Arduino onboard LED state according to it.
