If you are looking for an inexpensive, accurate, easy-to-use temperature sensor, then LM35 is an excellent choice. It has an accuracy of ±¼°C at room temperature and ±¾°C over a full −55°C to 150°C temperature range. It does not require any external trimming, although the main drawback of this sensor is that it outputs data in analog format, making it very prone to external noise and interference. So, in this tutorial, we will learn how to wire up a LM35 Temperature Sensor with Arduino and also we will output the temperature data in the serial monitor window.
