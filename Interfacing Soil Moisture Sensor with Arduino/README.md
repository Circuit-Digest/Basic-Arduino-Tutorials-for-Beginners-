The soil moisture sensor is the first thing that springs to mind when it comes to building your smart irrigation system or automatic plant watering system. With this sensor in place and a little Arduino support, we can design a system that can water your plants when it's needed, avoiding overwatering and underwatering.

In this article, we are going to interface the soil moisture sensor with an Arduino and measure the volumetric concentration of water inside the soil. This sensor is designed in a way that it can output data in both digital and analog modes. We will read this data and display the output status with an LED for digital output and we will use the serial monitor or an LED with PWM for analog output. So without further ado let's get right into it.

Note: As these projects are very simple, we are only providing the code, schematic, and a few essential images. If you want to get the images or code explanations, do check out the Circuit Digest website.
