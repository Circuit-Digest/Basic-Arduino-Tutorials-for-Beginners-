In many of our previous articles we have used many different types of temperature and humidity sensors
like DHT22, DHT11, DS18b20 and LM35 to measure environmental parameters. In every one of those articles there's 
one thing common, none of those sensors can measure barometric pressure. 
So in today's article we wanted to interface the BMP280 with an Arduino and measure barometric pressure. 
Why BMP280 you ask? Because this sensor costs low and it only provides both temperature and barometer readings,
 and as pressure changes with altitude we can also use it as an altimeter with Â±1 meter accuracy. But if you want to get all 
 the weather data in one package there exists another sensor named BME280 that provides Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure, 
 and Altitude but as you can probably imagine it comes with a high cost.
