When thinking about the best way to control games, drones, robots etc the first control mechanism that comes to our mind will be a joystick. Even though the working principle behind these are very basic, they provide excellent control and degree of resolution in many fields. The application of the Joystick is limitless. We can find the joysticks in various products from game controllers to advanced UAV navigation systems, in its various forms.
